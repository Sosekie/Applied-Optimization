Exercise 3 - Convex Optimization Problems

-------------

Theory exercise - Chenrui Fan

QCQP to SOCP (2 pts)

Linear Programming

Transform (2 pts)

Transform general LP to standard form (Bonus 2 pts)

Problems encountered：For the constraint conversion problem of Linear Programming, at first I didn't understand how to convert x in the original form which is in the real number domain to the positive real number domain, then I remembered that I could replace the original variable with the difference of two variables belonging to the positive real number domain.

The solutions to the other problems are clearly written in TheoryExercise.pdf and will not be repeated.
