Exercise 4 - Duality

-----------------------

Lagrange Duality (3 pts) - Lucien Gremaud

-----------------------

KKT Condition (2 pts) - Tristan Henchoz

-----------------------

Programming (5 pts) - Chenrui Fan

There is nothing difficult about the programming questions, just follow the prompts.

First, if there are no constraints, we can only check the gradients of this function.

Then, we'll check the inequality constraints and equality constraints, use the for loop.

Checking lamda is easy because we already have it. Check complementary slackness ask us to calculate every product of each lamda and inequality constraint result, justify its value.

Last, sum all the gradients and use "!gradient.isZero(eps_)" to justify.
